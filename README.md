## The Problem

*Engineering teams ship features fast but rarely have time to write proper release notes. Customers are left guessing what changed, support gets flooded with “what’s new?” questions, and the product feels stagnant even when it’s improving every week. Without clear, readable updates, churn creeps up because users don’t see the value being shipped.*

## The Solution

*ShipNotes connects to your GitHub repo and automatically turns raw commits into polished, customer‑ready release notes. Using AI, it groups related changes, rewrites commit messages in plain language, and formats them into professional “shipnotes” you can publish in minutes. Teams keep customers informed on every release without any manual writing or context‑switching.*

## Key Features

- **GitHub Integration** — Connect your repos and pull commit history automatically for each release.
- **AI Commit Summarisation** — Transform noisy commit messages into clear, human‑readable updates your customers can actually understand.
- **Smart Grouping** — Organise changes by feature, fix, or improvement so each shipnote reads like a story, not a git log.
- **One-Click Publish** — Review, tweak, and publish release notes to your changelog or shareable link in a few clicks.
